# Repair request: sync local main branch with origin

Multica Issue: DOT-974

## Failure code

- `agentmesh:repair:repo_main_behind`

## First repair candidate

The maintenance inspector reported that the shared local `main` branch was behind
`origin/main`, which can cause later repair or request generation to inspect stale
repository state.

## Reconciliation record

This worktree was checked out from `origin/main` after fetching the repository via
Multica's repository checkout path. The implementation branch starts at
`origin/main`, so the repair PR is generated from the current upstream state rather
than the stale local `main` pointer.

Release tags, package publishing, assets, secrets, permissions, production actions,
and Multica authority changes are intentionally out of scope for this repair.

## Verification

- `git status --short --branch`
- `cargo fmt --check`
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- `cargo test --workspace`
